# Life Expectancy Model
## Installation
Open a terminal and install the following dependencies
``` bash
pip install scikit-learn
pip install streamlit
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install seaborn
pip install matplotlib

## Introduction
Life expectancy is influenced by a wide range of fac-
tors, including socioeconomic status, lifestyle behaviors,
healthcare access, environmental conditions, and more.
Therefore, it is important to understand these factors in
order to design effective public health policies. Using a
dataset provided by the World Health Organization, we
will develop a comprehensive model to estimate life ex pectancy. 
Through various machine-learning techniques,
we will be able to develop a model that is both easy
to interpret as well as being accurate in predicting life
expectancy
